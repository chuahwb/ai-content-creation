# Gemini Image Generation Prompting Guide

Mastering Gemini 2.5 Flash Image Generation starts with a fundamental principle:  
**Describe the scene, don't just list keywords.**  
The model's core strength is its deep language understanding. A narrative, descriptive paragraph will almost always produce a better, more coherent image than a list of disconnected words.

## Prompting Strategies

### 1. Photorealistic Scenes

For realistic images, use photography terms such as camera angles, lens types, lighting, and fine details to guide the model toward photorealism.

**Template:**

```

A photorealistic [shot type] of [subject], [action or expression], set in
[environment]. The scene is illuminated by [lighting description], creating
a [mood] atmosphere. Captured with a [camera/lens details], emphasizing
[key textures and details]. The image should be in a [aspect ratio] format.

```

**Example:**

```

A photorealistic close-up portrait of an elderly Japanese ceramicist with
deep, sun-etched wrinkles and a warm, knowing smile. He is carefully
inspecting a freshly glazed tea bowl. The setting is his rustic,
sun-drenched workshop. The scene is illuminated by soft, golden hour light
streaming through a window, highlighting the fine texture of the clay.
Captured with an 85mm portrait lens, resulting in a soft, blurred background
(bokeh). The overall mood is serene and masterful. Vertical portrait
orientation.

```

---

### 2. Stylized Illustrations & Stickers

For creating stickers, icons, or assets, be explicit about the style and request a transparent background.

**Template:**

```

A [style] sticker of a [subject], featuring [key characteristics] and a
[color palette]. The design should have [line style] and [shading style].
The background must be transparent.

```

**Example:**

```

A kawaii-style sticker of a happy red panda wearing a tiny bamboo hat. It's
munching on a green bamboo leaf. The design features bold, clean outlines,
simple cel-shading, and a vibrant color palette. The background must be white.

```

---

### 3. Accurate Text in Images

Gemini excels at rendering text. Be clear about the text, the font style (descriptively), and the overall design.

**Template:**

```

Create a [image type] for [brand/concept] with the text "[text to render]"
in a [font style]. The design should be [style description], with a
[color scheme].

```

**Example:**

```

Create a modern, minimalist logo for a coffee shop called 'The Daily Grind'.
The text should be in a clean, bold, sans-serif font. The design should
feature a simple, stylized icon of a coffee bean seamlessly integrated
with the text. The color scheme is black and white.

```

---

### 4. Product Mockups & Commercial Photography

Perfect for clean, professional product shots for e-commerce, advertising, or branding.

**Template:**

```

A high-resolution, studio-lit product photograph of a [product description]
on a [background surface/description]. The lighting is a [lighting setup,
e.g., three-point softbox setup] to [lighting purpose]. The camera angle is
a [angle type] to showcase [specific feature]. Ultra-realistic, with sharp
focus on [key detail]. [Aspect ratio].

```

**Example:**

```

A high-resolution, studio-lit product photograph of a minimalist ceramic
coffee mug in matte black, presented on a polished concrete surface. The
lighting is a three-point softbox setup designed to create soft, diffused
highlights and eliminate harsh shadows. The camera angle is a slightly
elevated 45-degree shot to showcase its clean lines. Ultra-realistic, with
sharp focus on the steam rising from the coffee. Square image.

```

---

### 5. Minimalist & Negative Space Design

Great for creating backgrounds for websites, presentations, or marketing where text will be overlaid.

**Template:**

```

A minimalist composition featuring a single [subject] positioned in the
[bottom-right/top-left/etc.] of the frame. The background is a vast, empty
[color] canvas, creating significant negative space. Soft, subtle lighting.
[Aspect ratio].

```

**Example:**

```

A minimalist composition featuring a single, delicate red maple leaf
positioned in the bottom-right of the frame. The background is a vast, empty
off-white canvas, creating significant negative space for text. Soft,
diffused lighting from the top left. Square image.

```

---

### 6. Sequential Art (Comic Panel / Storyboard)

Builds on character consistency and scene description to create panels for visual storytelling.

**Template:**

```

A single comic book panel in a [art style] style. In the foreground,
[character description and action]. In the background, [setting details].
The panel has a [dialogue/caption box] with the text "[Text]". The lighting
creates a [mood] mood. [Aspect ratio].

```

**Example:**

```

A single comic book panel in a gritty, noir art style with high-contrast
black and white inks. In the foreground, a detective in a trench coat stands
under a flickering streetlamp, rain soaking his shoulders. In the
background, the neon sign of a desolate bar reflects in a puddle. A caption
box at the top reads "The city was a tough place to keep secrets." The
lighting is harsh, creating a dramatic, somber mood. Landscape.

```

## Prompts for Editing Images

Gemini also supports image editing modes that combine images and text prompts:

### 1. Adding and Removing Elements

Describe changes to an existing image that blend naturally with style, lighting, and perspective.

**Example Prompt:**

```

Using the provided image of my cat, please add a small, knitted wizard hat
on its head. Make it look like it's sitting comfortably and matches the soft
lighting of the photo.

```

---

### 2. Inpainting (Semantic Masking)

Define a "mask" to edit a specific part of the image while leaving the rest unchanged.

**Example Prompt:**

```

Using the provided image of a living room, change only the blue sofa to be
a vintage, brown leather chesterfield sofa. Keep the rest of the room,
including the pillows on the sofa and the lighting, unchanged.

```

---

### 3. Style Transfer

Transform an image into a different artistic style while preserving the original composition.

**Example Prompt:**

```

Transform the provided photograph of a modern city street at night into the
artistic style of Vincent van Gogh's 'Starry Night'. Preserve the original
composition of buildings and cars, but render all elements with swirling,
impasto brushstrokes and a dramatic palette of deep blues and bright yellows.

```

---

### 4. Advanced Composition: Combining Multiple Images

Combine elements from multiple images to create a new composite scene.

**Example Prompt:**

```

Create a professional e-commerce fashion photo. Take the blue floral dress
from the first image and let the woman from the second image wear it.
Generate a realistic, full-body shot of the woman wearing the dress, with
the lighting and shadows adjusted to match the outdoor environment.

```

---

### 5. High-Fidelity Detail Preservation

Preserve critical details of the base image while adding elements from another image naturally.

**Example Prompt:**

```

Take the first image of the woman with brown hair, blue eyes, and a neutral
expression. Add the logo from the second image onto her black t-shirt.
Ensure the woman's face and features remain completely unchanged. The logo
should look like it's naturally printed on the fabric, following the folds
of the shirt.
