### Core Philosophy: Guided Curation with Progressive Disclosure

Building on the principle of **Guided Curation**, prioritize deliberate, limited choices to prevent decision paralysis and ensure cohesive AI-generated visuals. Limit palettes to a maximum of 5-7 colors, aligning with real-world design standards (e.g., Material Design's emphasis on hierarchy and restraint). This avoids chaotic outputs while empowering the AI with structured, semantic data.

Incorporate **Progressive Disclosure** to start simple for most users (covering 90% of cases) and reveal advanced options on demand. Combine this with intelligent helpers to make the app feel like an "design partner," drawing from tools like Adobe Color and Canva. Infer ratios from roles by default for seamlessness, but offer optional fine-tuning in advanced modes to provide meaningful control without jargon overload.

### Recommended Design: The Tiered Brand Color Component

Structure the component as a collapsible panel in the brand kit form, using semantic roles to guide both users and the AI. Roles provide context (e.g., primary for dominant elements), enabling the AI to apply colors intelligently in social media visuals.

#### Tier 1: Default View (Simple & Intuitive Foundation)

This is the initial, uncluttered interface—clean and role-based to encourage quick, effective setups.

1. **Semantic Color Roles**: Use meaningful, predefined labels instead of generic slots. This mirrors designers' practices of assigning purpose to colors, helping the AI prioritize usage.

   - **Primary Color(s)**: 1-2 color pickers (e.g., main brand hue for backgrounds/large areas). Default to one; include a subtle "+ Add another primary" button.
   - **Accent Color**: 1 color picker (for CTAs, highlights, or pops of energy).
   - **Neutrals (Automated but Editable)**: Auto-generate defaults like dark neutral (#1A1A1A for text) and light neutral (#F9F9F9 for backgrounds). Display them as locked swatches with an "Edit" button to override. This follows standards where neutrals ensure readability without user input.

2. **Input Methods**: Each role has a swatch with:
   - Clickable color picker (spectrum slider + hex/RGB/HSL fields).
   - Optional text label (e.g., "Ocean Blue") for user reference.

3. **Live Palette Preview**: A horizontal bar or circle grid showing all colors in harmony, with subtle role labels. Include a tooltip: "Preview how these might appear in your AI-generated images."

4. **"Advanced Settings" Toggle/Link**: An unobtrusive button or link (e.g., "Add more colors or customize?") to expand without overwhelming.

**Why This Works**:
- **User-Centric**: Intuitive for non-designers; roles reduce guesswork.
- **AI-Empowering**: Structured data (e.g., {role: 'primary', hex: '#4A90E2'}) allows the AI to apply the 60-30-10 rule implicitly (primary dominant, accents sparse).
- **Best Practices Alignment**: Starts with a 3-4 color foundation, common in branding guidelines.

#### Tier 2: Advanced View (Expanded Control for Depth)

Toggle to reveal this layer, expanding the component inline. Maintain the 5-7 color cap (e.g., soft warning: "Palettes over 7 colors may dilute focus—consider simplifying?").

1. **Expanded Role-Based Inputs**: Add categories while keeping roles central. Users can add/remove within limits:
   - **Primary Colors (1-2)**: Dominant (inferred 60% usage).
   - **Secondary Colors (1-3)**: Supporting elements (inferred 30% usage, e.g., for illustrations or borders).
   - **Accent Colors (1-2)**: Highlights (inferred 10% usage).
   - **Neutral Colors (1-2)**: Text/backgrounds (inferred balanced use).

   Each color card includes picker, label, and a delete button. Enforce the cap by graying out "Add" after 7.

2. **Inferred Ratios with Optional Fine-Tuning**:
   - **Default Inference**: No manual input needed—AI infers proportions from roles (e.g., primaries get the lion's share). This eliminates jargon while adhering to the 60-30-10 rule.
   - **Optional Sliders**: For power users, add per-color sliders (0-100%) under a "Customize Ratios" sub-toggle. Auto-normalize totals and default to role-based values. Include a reset button to revert to inferences.

3. **Hierarchy and Reordering**: Drag-and-drop swatches within categories (e.g., prioritize one secondary over another). This signifies preference, guiding AI hierarchy without complexity.

4. **Preview Integration**: Enhance the live bar with a dynamic thumbnail (e.g., a mock social media post recolored in real-time). This provides iterative feedback, aligning with design workflows.

**Why This Balances Control**:
- Hides advanced features until needed, preventing overwhelm.
- Roles + inferred ratios offer seamless professionalism; sliders add depth for experts.
- Cap and reordering promote deliberate choices, reducing poor AI results.

#### Tier 3: Intelligent Helper Features (Seamless Assistance)

Embed these as non-intrusive buttons or auto-triggers to elevate usability, drawing from real-world tools.

1. **Generate from Logo/Image**: A prominent button ("Extract from Logo") allows upload of logo or brand asset. Backend analyzes (using libraries like those in RDKit or simple color quantization) to extract 3-5 dominant colors, auto-populating roles (e.g., most used as primary). Offer "Accept" or "Tweak" options. This saves time and ensures on-brand consistency.

2. **Color Harmony Suggestions**:
   - After selecting a primary, show a "Suggestions?" link next to accents/secondaries.
   - On click, display 3-4 options based on color theory (e.g., complementary, analogous, triadic via algorithms like those in Coolors). One-click apply educates users subtly.

3. **Built-in Accessibility and Validation Checker**:
   - Auto-run WCAG contrast checks (e.g., primary vs. neutral text).
   - Display icons: ✓ (Pass), ! (Warning) next to relevant pairs, with tooltips (e.g., "Low contrast—try darkening the text neutral for better readability").
   - Soft warnings for harmony issues (e.g., "Clashing accents? Consider analogous tones").

4. **Presets and Guidance**: Offer quick-start presets (e.g., "Minimal (3 colors)" or "Vibrant (5 colors)") at the top. Tooltips explain roles/ratios: "Primary: Used most (60%) for brand dominance."

**Integration with Brand Kit**: Link to brand voice (e.g., suggest cool tones for "professional") and logo (auto-extract). Pass to AI as JSON: {colors: [{role: string, hex: string, ratio: number?}]}.
