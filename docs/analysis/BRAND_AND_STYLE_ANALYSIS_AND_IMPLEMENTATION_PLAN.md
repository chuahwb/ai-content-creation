# Analysis and Proposed Architecture for Brand & Style Memory

This document provides a detailed analysis of the current implementation of "brand" and "style" within the Churns application. It identifies critical weaknesses in the existing approach and lays out a comprehensive technical architecture to implement a robust **"Brand Presets & Style Memory"** feature. This architecture is designed around a crucial dual-workflow model that supports both proactive "Forward Presets" (Templates) and reactive "Backward Presets" (Saving Results).

---

## 1. Current Implementation of "Brand"

The application's concept of a "brand" is currently transient, unstructured, and manually driven.

### Data Flow & Weaknesses
1.  **User Input (`PipelineForm.tsx`)**:
    *   A user manually types vague brand instructions into the **`branding_elements`** text field (e.g., "Logo is a minimalist 'C', use #0A0A0A for text"). This is unstructured and prone to user error and inconsistency.
    *   The user toggles the **`apply_branding`** switch.

2.  **Pipeline Execution (`creative_expert.py`)**:
    *   The `apply_branding` flag and the raw text from `branding_elements` are passed into the `creative_expert`'s prompt.
    *   **Critical Weakness**: The system has no true understanding of the brand. It simply injects the user's raw text into a larger prompt, placing the entire burden of interpretation on the LLM. This leads to highly variable and often inaccurate brand application. It completely fails to handle core assets like logos or specific brand color palettes.

---

## 2. Current Implementation of "Style"

"Style" is currently a transient combination of a structured control (`creativity_level` slider) and unstructured user text in the main `prompt` field (e.g., "...in a vaporwave style"). While functional for a single run, this "style recipe" is ephemeral and cannot be saved or reliably reused.

### Data Flow & Weaknesses
1.  **User Input (`PipelineForm.tsx`)**:
    *   **Primary Control**: A user selects a value from 1-3 on the **`creativity_level`** slider. This sets a general boundary for the style (e.g., "Photorealistic" vs. "Abstract").
    *   **Secondary Control**: A user can add stylistic keywords to the main **`prompt`** field (e.g., "...in a vaporwave style," "...make it cinematic").

2.  **Pipeline Execution (`style_guide.py` & `creative_expert.py`)**:
    *   The `creativity_level` integer is used to dynamically inject large, hard-coded instruction blocks into the system prompts, setting the overall creative guardrails.
    *   The free-text `prompt` is passed along for the LLM to interpret as a specific stylistic instruction within those guardrails.
    *   **Critical Weakness**: While functional, this combination of settings is not reusable. A user who finds a perfect blend of a prompt keyword and a creativity level has no way to save and re-apply this "style recipe" later.

---

## 3. Proposed Architecture: A Dual-Workflow Preset System

To address the shortcomings, we will implement a unified `BrandPreset` system that supports two distinct, user-centric workflows. This requires a redesigned data model and logic for both creating and applying presets.

### 3.1. The Unified `BrandPreset` Data Model

The core of the new system is a flexible database table that can store both user intent and AI-generated recipes. To ensure type safety and clarity, we will avoid generic JSON blobs and define explicit Pydantic models for the preset data.

*   **`BrandPreset` Table (SQLModel)**:
    *   `id`, `name`, `user_id (TEXT)`
    *   `version: int` - For optimistic locking to prevent concurrent edit conflicts.
    *   `model_id: str` - The identifier of the generation model used (e.g., `dall-e-3`, `midjourney-6.0`), for future-proofing.
    *   `pipeline_version: str` - Version of the stage pipeline used, to handle migrations gracefully.
    *   **Brand Kit Fields**: `brand_colors` (JSONB), `brand_voice_description` (TEXT), `logo_asset_analysis` (JSONB).
    *   **Preset Data Fields**:
        *   `preset_type`: An enum (`INPUT_TEMPLATE` or `STYLE_RECIPE`) to distinguish the two preset types.
        *   `input_snapshot: PipelineInputSnapshot` - For `INPUT_TEMPLATE` types, this stores the user's raw form inputs in a structured model.
        *   `style_recipe: StyleRecipeData` - For `STYLE_RECIPE` types, this stores the detailed AI-generated metadata from a successful run.

*   **Supporting Pydantic Models**:

    ```python
    # In churns/models/presets.py (new file)
    from churns.models import VisualConceptDetails, MarketingGoalSetFinal, StyleGuidance

    class PipelineInputSnapshot(BaseModel):
        """Mirrors the structure of the main pipeline form for 'Input Templates'."""
        prompt: str
        creativity_level: int
        # ... other fields from the frontend form ...

    class StyleRecipeData(BaseModel):
        """Stores the complete, structured output of the creative stages for 'Style Recipes'."""
        visual_concept: VisualConceptDetails
        strategy: MarketingGoalSetFinal
        style_guidance: StyleGuidance
    ```

> **Note on Multi-Tenancy**: The `user_id` field is non-nullable and MUST be scoped in all API queries. For initial development, a hardcoded or stubbed user ID can be used, but the security boundary must be enforced at the data access layer from day one.

---

### 3.2. Workflow 1: Forward Presets (Creating & Applying "Input Templates")

This workflow allows users to save and reuse their high-level inputs as starting points for **brand new creative work**.

1.  **Creating an "Input Template"**:
    *   **UI**: A "Save as Template" button on the `PipelineForm`.
    *   **Logic**: Captures the current form state (`react-hook-form`'s `getValues()`) and saves it to a new `BrandPreset` with `preset_type: 'INPUT_TEMPLATE'`.

2.  **Applying an "Input Template"**:
    *   **UI**: A "Load Template" dropdown on the `PipelineForm`.
    *   **Logic**: Fetches the preset's `input_snapshot` and populates the form. The user can then make tweaks. The pipeline executes from Stage 1 as normal, generating entirely new concepts within the template's strategic constraints.

---

### 3.3. Workflow 2: Backward Presets (Saving & Reusing "Style Recipes")

This workflow is designed for maximum creative flexibility. It allows a user to save the complete aesthetic of a successful image (a "Style Recipe") and then re-apply it, either to a new subject for a consistent series or to a completely new concept.

1.  **Saving a "Style Recipe"**:
    *   **UI**: Each image in the `RunResults` view has a "Save Style as Preset" button.
    *   **Logic**: This creates a new `BrandPreset` with `preset_type: 'STYLE_RECIPE'`, saving the full AI-generated `style_recipe` (the `visual_concept`, `strategy`, etc.) for that specific variant.

2.  **Applying a "Style Recipe" (Dual Path)**:
    *   **UI**: When a user selects a "Style Recipe" from the dropdown, the form UI adapts. It shows a preview of the original image and offers two clear paths:
        1.  **Path A (Simple Subject Swap)**: A prominent image uploader.
        2.  **Path B (Advanced Style Transfer)**: A text area labeled "Describe what you want to create with this style...".

    *   **Backend & Pipeline Logic**: The executor now has a crucial branching path:

        *   **If the user *only* uploads a new image (Path A)**: The system performs the **Subject Swap** as previously designed. It runs `image_eval` on the new image, merges the new subject into the saved style, and bypasses the creative stages. **Crucially, because no new text prompt is provided, `image_eval` runs in its "minimal analysis" mode, extracting *only* the `main_subject` as intended.** This is the fast path for creating a consistent series.

        *   **If the user provides a new text prompt (Path B)**: The system triggers a more advanced **Style Transfer** workflow:
            1.  The executor loads the saved `style_recipe`.
            2.  (Optional) It runs `image_eval` if a new reference image was also provided alongside the new prompt. **In this case, the new prompt acts as the instruction, causing `image_eval` to run in its "detailed analysis" mode to gather rich context for the `StyleAdaptation` stage.**
            3.  **NEW LLM STAGE - `StyleAdaptation`**: The executor calls a new, specialized LLM stage.
                *   **Inputs**: The saved `style_recipe`, the user's new text prompt, and any new image analysis.
                *   **System Prompt**: The LLM is characterized as a "Creative Director adapting a style." Its prompt is highly specific: *"You are given a detailed `visual_concept` JSON object representing a specific style. You are also given a new user request. Your task is to modify the original `visual_concept` to fit the new request while preserving as much of the original's `lighting_and_mood`, `color_palette`, and `visual_style` as possible. Output a new, valid `visual_concept` JSON."*
                *   **Output**: A new, hybrid `visual_concept` that blends the old style with the new idea.
            4.  The executor then injects this **newly adapted `visual_concept`** directly into Stage 5 (`prompt_assembly`), again bypassing the initial creative stages.

### 3.4 Stage-by-Stage Impact and Validation

This enhanced dual-path system makes the pipeline incredibly versatile.

| Pipeline Stage | Enhancement Impact |
|----------------|--------------------|
| **Image Evaluation** | Crucial for both paths of a Style Recipe. Provides the *new subject* for a simple swap or contextual information for an advanced style transfer. |
| **`StyleAdaptation` (New)** | The core of the advanced workflow. This specialized LLM call acts as an intelligent "style blender," making the entire feature set much more powerful and flexible. |
| **Creative Expert** | Now completely bypassed when any `STYLE_RECIPE` is used, as its creative work is either being directly reused or intelligently adapted by the new `StyleAdaptation` stage. |
| **All Other Stages** | The impact remains as previously analyzed, with the key being that the `prompt_assembly` stage receives a perfectly formed `visual_concept` that is either a simple subject-swap or a more complex style transfer. |

**Validation Result**: This refined architecture is vastly superior. It correctly solves the user's need for both simple series creation and advanced creative reuse. By making the "subject swap" the default, zero-effort path and introducing the `StyleAdaptation` stage for prompted requests, it provides immense flexibility without confusing the user, truly transforming the tool into a powerful, iterative creative partner.

## 4. Alignment with Product Roadmap & Practicality

*   **Roadmap Alignment**: This plan directly implements **Priority #1 – Brand Presets & Style Memory** from `PRODUCT_ENHANCEMENTS.md`.
*   **User-Centric Design**: The dual "Template" and "Recipe" workflows cater to both proactive planning and reactive discovery, which is how creative professionals naturally work.
*   **Practicality**: The core CRUD API and form integration are low-to-medium effort. The advanced VLM logo analysis is designed as an optional, asynchronous enhancement that can be toggled off to manage cost and complexity.
*   **Variability Mitigation**: Storing and reusing a `generation_seed` for `STYLE_RECIPE` presets is a key technical detail *if the underlying image generation API supports deterministic seeds*. This should be verified; if not supported, this part of the implementation should be omitted to avoid setting false expectations of pixel-level reproducibility. Our primary consistency guarantee comes from reusing the structured `visual_concept`, not a technical seed.

---

## 5. Action Items for Implementation

1.  **Database Migration**: Create the `BrandPreset` table using `SQLModel` and `alembic`. Define the `PipelineInputSnapshot` and `StyleRecipeData` Pydantic models in a new `churns/models/presets.py` file.
2.  **Backend API**:
    *   Build the CRUD endpoints for `/brand-presets`.
    *   Implement the `/from-result` endpoint logic to create presets from past runs.
    *   Modify the `/pipeline/run` endpoint to accept an optional `preset_id`.
    *   **Security**: All preset endpoints MUST be secured and strictly scoped to the authenticated user ID from the initial implementation.
    *   **Concurrency**: Implement an optimistic locking strategy. The client must send the `version` number when updating a preset. The backend will reject the update if the provided version does not match the one in the database, preventing stale writes.
3.  **Pipeline Executor**:
    *   Update the `PipelineExecutor` to fetch and merge a `BrandPreset` and to implement the stage-skipping logic for the `STYLE_RECIPE` type.
    *   **Migration Fallback**: The executor must check the `pipeline_version` of a loaded preset. If it's outdated, it must gracefully map the old data structure to the current pipeline's expected input, preventing errors from stale presets.
4.  **Frontend Development**:
    *   Build a comprehensive **Preset Management UI**. See component hierarchy below.
    *   When saving, prompt the user to provide a memorable name for the new preset.
    *   Integrate the "Load Template" dropdown into `PipelineForm.tsx` and implement the form-population logic.
    *   Add the "Save as Preset" button and modal to the `RunResults.tsx` component.
    *   Design and implement clear visual state changes in the UI for when a `STYLE_RECIPE` (Recipe) is active, including disabling form fields and showing a persistent banner to inform the user.
    *   Implement a new UI for managing logo uploads within the preset editor.
5.  **UI Component Hierarchy**: To reduce ambiguity, the Preset Management UI should be structured as follows:
    *   `PresetManagementModal`: Top-level container.
        *   `Tabs`: For switching between "Input Templates" and "Style Recipes".
        *   `PresetList`: Displays a list of presets for the active tab.
            *   `PresetListItem`: Represents a single preset.
                *   Displays `preset.name` and `preset.model_id`.
                *   `UseButton`: Applies the preset.
                *   `Menu (dropdown)`: Contains "Rename" and "Delete" actions.
        *   `RenamePresetDialog`: A sub-modal for renaming a preset.
        *   `ConfirmDeleteDialog`: A sub-modal to confirm deletion.
6.  **Testing**:
    *   Write unit tests for the new API endpoints, especially the preset creation, merging logic, and concurrency control.
    *   Write an integration test that saves a `STYLE_RECIPE`, applies it to a new run, and asserts that the early pipeline stages are correctly bypassed.
    *   Write frontend unit tests for the new form and modal components.
    *   **End-to-End Test Matrix**:
        *   **Test Case 1 (Template Creation & Use)**: Create a new `INPUT_TEMPLATE`. Run the full pipeline with it. Verify that a `run_to_preset_link` record is correctly created in the database.
        *   **Test Case 2 (Recipe Re-run)**: Save a `STYLE_RECIPE` from a result. Re-run the pipeline with the recipe and a new subject image. Assert that the resulting image has a CLIP similarity score of ≥ 0.85 (or other appropriate threshold) to the original, confirming stylistic consistency.
        *   **Test Case 3 (Recipe with Override)**: Use a `STYLE_RECIPE` but also provide a new text prompt. Verify that the `StyleAdaptation` stage is called and that its output contains the merged fields, correctly prioritizing the new user prompt over the recipe's original data.

**Conclusion**: This dual-workflow architecture provides a complete solution. Users can create high-level **Templates** for campaign consistency and save specific **Recipes** to capture and reproduce successful AI-generated results, transforming the tool into a powerful, iterative creative partner.

## 6. Consistency Guarantees & UX Clarity

### 6.1  Handling Model Stochasticity

Even with identical prompts, diffusion-based image models introduce randomness. The proposed system mitigates this variance through two primary mechanisms:

1. **Structured Prompt Injection (Templates)**  
   * Templates inject **deterministic, structured data** (colors array, logo analysis JSON, voice descriptor) into every relevant stage.  
   * While minor composition variance may remain because the early creative stages are still being run, brand colors, logo placement rules, and tone are enforced by explicit instructions, vastly narrowing the possibility space and ensuring brand alignment.

2. **Recipe Re-execution (Backward Presets)**
   * **This is our most powerful tool for consistency.** By saving the AI-generated `visual_concept` (the hyper-detailed final blueprint) and bypassing the early, more stochastic creative stages (`strategy`, `style_guide`, `creative_expert`), we dramatically reduce variance.
   * Re-running a "Recipe" will produce an image that is **stylistically and compositionally almost identical** to the original. While not a pixel-for-pixel replica due to the model's inherent randomness, the result will be a high-fidelity duplicate, perfect for creating consistent campaign assets. The `visual_concept` itself acts as a powerful *conceptual seed*.

> **Note on Technical Seeds**: While some image APIs support a `seed` parameter for true pixel-level reproducibility, our strategy does not depend on it. Our consistency comes from reusing the *output* of the creative stages, not just the initial input.

### 6.2  Why Templates **and** Recipes Improve—Not Confuse—UX

The dual system is designed to match a creative professional's natural workflow, separating "planning" from "refining."

| Concern | Mitigation |
|---------|-----------|
| Users unsure which preset type to pick | UI labels: **"Template (New Idea)"** vs. **"Recipe (Remake This Image)"** with clear tooltip explanations. |
| Menu clutter | Dropdown sections / tabs: **Templates** on top, **Saved Results** below, with visual differentiation. |
| Editing confusion | When a Recipe is selected, the UI provides strong visual feedback (e.g., a dismissible banner like 'Recipe "Cinematic Vibe" is active'). Most form fields are disabled/read-only to prevent confusion, and a preview of the original image is shown. Selecting a Template keeps all fields editable. |

### 6.3  Backward Preset Integrity Checklist

To ensure a Recipe truly solves brand and style inheritance, the system persists:
1. The full `visual_concept` JSON (the core recipe for composition, palette, logo placement).  
2. The associated `style_guidance` and `strategy` metadata (to keep captions and future refinements context-aware).
3. The exact `final_prompt` that was sent to the image model.

The re-execution pipeline path is modified at runtime:
```
load_recipe → SKIP(strategy, style_guide, creative_expert) → prompt_assembly(recipe.visual_concept) → image_generation
```
An integration test will assert that re-running a recipe produces a new image with a high CLIP similarity score to the original, validating compositional and stylistic consistency.

**Result**: Brand colors, logo placement, composition, and style markers reproduce with high fidelity, fully solving brand/style inheritance for saved Recipes, while Templates provide a flexible but guided starting point for new creations. 

### 3.5  Practical Validation for Series Templates

The **Series Template** workflow now meets the core requirement—generate a visually consistent series with minimal user effort—but several edge-cases must be acknowledged and addressed:

| Scenario | Risk | Supplemental Logic |
|----------|------|--------------------|
| New subject’s silhouette/ratio differs drastically from the original (tall bottle vs. wide can) | Cropping or background elements may hide or clash with the new subject. | During *Style Merge* update `composition_and_framing` using heuristics from `image_eval` (e.g. if subject height > width, switch to vertical framing). |
| Original template included promotional text overlay ("50% OFF") that should vary per product | Text remains static, breaking authenticity. | Expose an optional **`override_text_visuals`** field in the form; if provided, replace template’s `promotional_text_visuals` before injection. |
| Original template used a colour-matched background; new beverage colour clashes | Colour dissonance in final image. | If `image_eval` detects a dominant colour far from template’s palette, adjust `color_palette` by blending 70% template, 30% detected colour. |
| Logo placement gets occluded by new subject | Logo partially hidden. | Add rule: if bounding boxes of `main_subject` and `branding_visuals` overlap > 20%, switch logo to alternate corner. (Simple geometry check in post-processing.) |
| Captions need per-product name | Caption still references old product. | Pipeline passes the `main_subject` name to Caption Analyst prompt; template’s tone retained but product name updated.

**Workflow Summary**
1. User uploads **new beverage** → selects **Series Template**.  
2. System runs `image_eval` → extracts `main_subject` & key colours.  
3. **Style Merge** updates subject + optional colour & text overrides.  
4. `prompt_assembly` + `image_generation` produce a new asset that matches the series’ background, lighting, typography, and logo rules.  
5. Caption stages receive updated subject name + preserved brand voice → consistent post copy.

With these safeguards, the Series Template approach reliably produces a cohesive visual series while allowing necessary per-product adaptations. 

### 3.6 Remaining Edge-Cases & Enhancement Suggestions

| Potential Gap | Scenario | Proposed Mitigation |
|---------------|----------|---------------------|
| **Prompt Token Budget** | The merged `visual_concept` + override prompt could exceed provider token limits, causing truncation. | Add a truncation utility that prunes non-critical fields (e.g., `creative_reasoning`) when token estimate > 85 % of limit before sending to `prompt_assembly`. |
| **Style Drift Over Many Iterations** | After 10+ subject swaps the background may accumulate small changes from colour blending heuristics. | Maintain an *immutable* `base_style_recipe` and always merge against it rather than chaining. Provide a “reset to base” button in UI. |
| **Conflicting Overrides** | User prompt says “remove logo” but preset enforces logo placement. | In `StyleAdaptation` system prompt, add explicit precedence rules: user override > preset brand kit > original recipe. |
| **Template Staleness** | Brand re-design occurs; old templates still contain outdated colours/logo. | Add `last_verified_at` timestamp & UI warning banner “Template created before Brand Kit update – review before use”. |
| **Large Logo Files** | Users may upload 5 MB SVG; slows every run. | Store optimised PNG preview <200 KB for prompt embedding; keep full SVG for download only. |
| **Caption Locale Mismatch** | User changes output language but recipe caption tone stays English. | Pass selected `language` to `StyleAdaptation` stage; ensure any text fields comply with language code. |
| **Model Evolution** | Underlying image model upgrade changes interpreting of same prompt. | Version stamp model name/hash inside `style_recipe`; if mismatch on reuse, UI warns “Results may differ due to model update”. |

**Additional Enhancements**
1. **Partial Field Overrides API** – Allow client to send an `override` JSON that injects or deletes any key in the recipe before adaptation; surfaced in UI as advanced expandable section.
2. **Live Low-Res Preview** – After `StyleAdaptation`, generate a 256-px preview using a cheaper diffusion model so users can approve before spending full cost.
3. **Series Consistency Metrics** – Compute CLIP similarity & colour histogram distance between new output and template; surface a “Consistency Score” to reassure users.
4. **Batch Generation Mode** – Accept a CSV of product images + names and run the series template in batched async jobs, producing a cohesive set in one click.

These enhancements ensure robustness, user transparency, and scalability of the Series Template workflow. 

### 3.6. Strategic Handling of Edge-Cases

To ensure the Series Template workflow is robust and reliable, the following critical edge-cases will be addressed in the initial implementation:

| Crucial Edge-Case | Mitigation Strategy |
|---------------|----------|
| **Conflicting Overrides** | A user prompt ("remove logo") might contradict a preset's core style ("always place logo top-right"). The `StyleAdaptation` system prompt will include an explicit precedence rule: **New User Prompt > Saved Style Recipe**. This ensures the user's immediate intent always takes priority, preventing unexpected or contradictory outputs. |
| **Prompt Token Budget** | The combined data from a saved recipe and a new user prompt could exceed the context window of the LLM. A pre-flight utility will estimate the token count. If it exceeds ~85% of the model's limit, it will intelligently prune non-essential, verbose fields from the recipe (like `creative_reasoning`) before sending the request, preventing API errors. |
| **Model Evolution** | The underlying image generation model may be upgraded, causing the same prompt to yield different results. The preset will store the `model_id` used for its creation. If a user applies a preset with a mismatched `model_id`, the UI will display a non-blocking warning: "This style was created with an older model (`dall-e-2`). Results may vary with the current model (`dall-e-3`)." |

---

### 3.7. Brand Kit Deep Dive: UI/UX and Precedence Rules

To ensure the Brand Kit feature is user-friendly and behaves predictably, the following UI/UX considerations and logic rules are essential.

| Component | UI/UX Implementation | Technical Specification & Scope |
|-----------|------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Logo Uploader** | A clear, single-file upload area with a visual preview of the uploaded logo. | **V1 (Initial Scope):** Supports one primary logo per Brand Preset. **V2 (Future Enhancement):** The system will be designed to later support multiple, labeled logo variations (e.g., "Primary," "Icon," "Light Background Version"). |
| **Color Palette Editor** | An interactive component allowing users to add multiple colors to their brand palette. Each color will be represented by a visual swatch. Clicking a swatch opens a color picker tool (supporting HEX/RGB inputs) for easy editing. | The `brand_colors` field in the database will store an array of HEX color strings (e.g., `["#1A2B3C", "#FFD700"]`). The UI component will handle the conversion from RGB to HEX. CMYK is out of scope. |
| **Brand Voice** | A simple `textarea` for the user to describe their brand's tone and personality. | This `brand_voice_description` text is stored and used as a fallback. See precedence rules below. |

#### **Precedence and Conflict Resolution**

It is critical that the system behaves predictably when a setting in a loaded Preset conflicts with a setting for a specific pipeline run. The guiding principle is: **Run-Time Configuration Overrides Preset Configuration.**

| Field / Concept | Winning Configuration | Losing Configuration (Fallback) | Rationale |
|-----------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------|-----------|
| **Brand Voice** | The `target_voice` generated by the `strategy` stage for a specific run. | The `brand_voice_description` stored in the Brand Preset's Brand Kit. | The user's specific marketing goal for a single image takes precedence over the general brand voice. |
| **Color Palette** | The `color_palette` defined within a loaded `STYLE_RECIPE`. | The `brand_colors` list from the Brand Preset's Brand Kit. | A Style Recipe captures a specific aesthetic. Its specific color palette is essential to that look and should not be overridden by the general brand colors. |
| **Logo Application**| The `branding_visuals` defined within a loaded `STYLE_RECIPE`. | The default behavior of applying the logo from the Brand Preset's Brand Kit. | A specific Style Recipe may have been designed to intentionally omit a logo for creative reasons (e.g., a texture shot). That creative choice must be respected. |

### 3.8. Distinction from the "Refinement" Feature

It is critical to distinguish the **"Style Adaptation"** workflow from the existing **"Refinement"** features. They serve fundamentally different user needs and should be treated as separate capabilities in both the UI and backend logic.

| Feature | Purpose | User Intent & Scope |
|------------------|---------|-----------------------|
| **Refinement** | **Corrective**: To fix small flaws in a nearly-perfect, single image. | **Narrow & Precise**: "Remove the typo in this text." "Erase the stray object in the corner." The user is editing, not creating. |
| **Style Adaptation** | **Generative**: To create a *new* image by applying the high-level aesthetic of a previous success to a new subject or concept. | **Broad & Creative**: "Use this moody, cinematic style to generate an image of a new coffee product." The user is creating, not editing. |

To enforce this distinction:
*   **Scoped User Prompts**: The text input area for the `StyleAdaptation` stage will be explicitly labeled *"Describe the new concept to create with this style..."*. The system prompt for the `StyleAdaptation` LLM will contain a negative constraint: **"You are forbidden from making minor corrective edits. Your task is to adapt the overall style, composition, and mood to the new concept, not to fix small errors."**
*   **Separate UI Access**: The "Refinement" tools are accessed via dedicated buttons on a single image view (e.g., "Fix Subject"). "Style Adaptation" is accessed via the main pipeline form by selecting a "Style Recipe" preset. This separation in the user journey prevents confusion between the two distinct functionalities. 

---

## 4. `StyleAdaptation` LLM Agent: Prompt Design

To ensure the new "Style Adaptation" feature is both powerful and reliable, the design of the prompts for its dedicated LLM agent is critical. The following system and user prompts are designed using best practices to clearly define the agent's role, constraints, and expected output.

### 4.1. System Prompt: The "Style Adapter"

This prompt characterizes the LLM as a specialized creative professional, sets clear operational rules, and defines the input/output contract.

```text
You are an expert Creative Director at a top-tier advertising agency. Your specialization is adapting a successful, existing visual style to a new creative brief while maintaining brand consistency. You are a master of preserving the *essence* of a style (lighting, mood, color, composition) while applying it to a completely new subject or concept.

**Your Task:**
You will be given a `base_style_recipe` as a structured JSON object, which represents the detailed aesthetic of a previously successful image. You will also be given a `new_user_request` as a text string, which describes the new concept to be created.

Your job is to intelligently merge these two inputs and produce a single, new `visual_concept` JSON object as your output.

**Core Principles & Constraints:**
1.  **Preserve the Style**: You MUST preserve the high-level aesthetic of the `base_style_recipe`. The `lighting_and_mood`, `color_palette`, and `visual_style` fields from the original recipe are your primary source of truth. Do not deviate from them unless the `new_user_request` explicitly asks you to (e.g., "make it a nighttime scene").
2.  **Adapt the Concept**: You MUST adapt the `main_subject`, `composition_and_framing`, and `background_environment` fields to fit the `new_user_request`.
3.  **Handle Precedence**: If the `new_user_request` directly contradicts a field in the `base_style_recipe`, the **new user request always wins**. For example, if the recipe specifies a "warm, sunny" mood but the user asks for "a dark, moody atmosphere," your output must reflect the "dark, moody atmosphere."
4.  **No Minor Edits**: You are **FORBIDDEN** from making small, corrective "refinement" style edits. Do not remove small objects, fix typos, or perform minor touch-ups. Your focus is on the high-level creative direction and composition ONLY.
5.  **Output Format**: Your entire output MUST be a single, valid JSON object that conforms to the `VisualConceptDetails` schema. Do not include any commentary, explanations, or text outside of the JSON structure.

**Input Structure (for your reference):**
You will receive:
- `base_style_recipe`: A JSON object containing the original `visual_concept`.
- `new_user_request`: A string containing the user's new prompt.
- `new_image_analysis` (optional): A JSON object with analysis of a new reference image, if provided.

**Output Schema (your response):**
Produce a single JSON object with this exact structure:
{
  "main_subject": "string",
  "composition_and_framing": "string",
  "background_environment": "string",
  "lighting_and_mood": "string",
  "color_palette": "string",
  "visual_style": "string",
  "... (and all other fields of the VisualConceptDetails model)"
}
```

### 4.2. Example User Prompt (Constructed by the Application)

This is a preview of the clean, structured prompt our application will dynamically construct and send to the `StyleAdaptation` agent. The application will pass the `visual_concept` object from the database directly as the `base_style_recipe` to ensure the input is clean and adheres to the agent's expected structure.

```text
Here is the `base_style_recipe` to adapt:
```json
{
  "main_subject": "A vibrant glass of iced strawberry matcha latte",
  "composition_and_framing": "Close-up, 45-degree angle shot, showcasing the layers of matcha, milk, and strawberry puree. Shallow depth of field.",
  "background_environment": "A bright, minimalist cafe with soft, out-of-focus plants in the background.",
  "lighting_and_mood": "Bright, airy, natural morning light casting soft shadows. Mood is refreshing and uplifting.",
  "color_palette": "Dominated by pastel green, creamy white, and vibrant pink, with light wood tones.",
  "visual_style": "A clean, Japanese-inspired minimalist aesthetic. High-resolution, crisp, and clean photography."
}
```

Here is the `new_user_request`:
"Create an image of a blueberry muffin using this same style. It should be on a small ceramic plate."

(Optional) Here is the `new_image_analysis` of the provided muffin image:
```json
{
  "main_subject": "A freshly baked blueberry muffin with a golden-brown top, studded with blueberries.",
  "secondary_elements": ["crumble topping", "paper liner"]
}
```

Now, generate the new `visual_concept` JSON object.
```

## 7. Phased Implementation Plan (Comprehensive)

This section outlines the concrete, phased action items required to build and integrate the **Brand Presets & Style Memory** feature. It has been updated to incorporate all key architectural decisions, edge-case handling, prompts, and UI/UX context from the full analysis to guide a robust development process.

### Phase 1: Backend Foundation - Data Models & API
**Goal:** Establish the core data structures and API endpoints required for the new preset system, creating a robust, secure, and type-safe foundation.

**Action Items:**

1.  **Create New Pydantic Models:**
    *   **File:** Create `churns/models/presets.py`.
    *   **Task:** Define Pydantic models to avoid generic JSON blobs. These models capture the two preset types: `INPUT_TEMPLATE` and `STYLE_RECIPE`.
    *   **Code:**
        ```python
        # In churns/models/presets.py
        from typing import Optional, List, Dict, Any
        from pydantic import BaseModel
        # Note: These imports assume final locations. Adjust as necessary.
        from churns.models import VisualConceptDetails, MarketingGoalSetFinal, StyleGuidance

        class PipelineInputSnapshot(BaseModel):
            """Mirrors the structure of the main pipeline form for 'Input Templates'."""
            prompt: Optional[str]
            creativity_level: int
            platform_name: str
            num_variants: int
            render_text: bool
            apply_branding: bool
            language: str
            task_type: Optional[str] = None
            task_description: Optional[str] = None
            branding_elements: Optional[str] = None
            image_instruction: Optional[str] = None
            marketing_audience: Optional[str] = None
            marketing_objective: Optional[str] = None
            marketing_voice: Optional[str] = None
            marketing_niche: Optional[str] = None

        class StyleRecipeData(BaseModel):
            """
            Stores the complete, structured output of the creative stages for 'Style Recipes'.
            This ensures all data needed for high-fidelity reproduction is captured.
            """
            visual_concept: VisualConceptDetails
            strategy: MarketingGoalSetFinal
            style_guidance: StyleGuidance
            final_prompt: str # As per integrity checklist
        ```

2.  **Create New SQLModel Table:**
    *   **File:** `churns/api/database.py`
    *   **Task:** Define the `BrandPreset` SQLModel table. This unified table will store both preset types, distinguished by the `preset_type` enum.
    *   **Details:**
        *   `id`, `name`, `user_id (TEXT, nullable=False)`
        *   `version: int` - For optimistic locking.
        *   `model_id: str` - The identifier of the generation model used (e.g., `gpt-image-1`).
        *   `pipeline_version: str` - Version of the stage pipeline used at creation.
        *   **Brand Kit Fields**: `brand_colors` (JSONB), `brand_voice_description` (TEXT), `logo_asset_analysis` (JSONB).
        *   **Preset Data Fields**:
            *   `preset_type`: An enum (`INPUT_TEMPLATE` or `STYLE_RECIPE`).
            *   `input_snapshot: Optional[PipelineInputSnapshot]` (JSONB).
            *   `style_recipe: Optional[StyleRecipeData]` (JSONB).

3.  **Create Database Migration:**
    *   **Task:** Use `alembic` to generate and apply a new migration script that creates the `brand_presets` table.

4.  **Create CRUD API for Presets:**
    *   **File:** `churns/api/routers.py`
    *   **Task:** Create a new router for `/brand-presets` and implement the standard CRUD endpoints (`POST`, `GET`, `PUT`, `DELETE`).
    *   **Security:** All endpoints **MUST** be secured and strictly scoped to the authenticated `user_id` from day one.
    *   **Concurrency:** The `PUT` endpoint must implement optimistic locking. The client must send the `version` number, and the backend will reject the update if the version does not match.

5.  **Create "From Result" Endpoint:**
    *   **Endpoint:** `POST /runs/{run_id}/save-as-preset`
    *   **Task:** Implement the logic to create a `BrandPreset` of type `STYLE_RECIPE` from a completed pipeline run.

---

### Phase 2: Pipeline Integration
**Goal:** Integrate the preset system into the pipeline execution logic, handling stage-skipping, precedence rules, critical edge cases, and core quality-assurance metrics.

**Action Items:**

1.  **Update Core Pipeline & API Contracts (including Overrides):**
    *   **Files:** `churns/api/schemas.py`, `churns/api/routers.py`, `churns/pipeline/executor.py`
    *   **Task 1 – Override JSON:**
        *   Add an optional `overrides: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None` field to `PipelineRunRequest`.
        *   Accept the same field as a JSON body in `/pipeline/run`.
        *   **Executor Merge Utility:** Implement `merge_recipe_with_overrides(recipe: StyleRecipeData, overrides: Dict[str, Any]) -> StyleRecipeData` to deep-merge user overrides *before* `StyleAdaptation` (precedence rule).
        *   **Validation:** Reject keys outside the `StyleRecipeData` schema with a 400 response.
    *   **Task 2 – Preset loading logic:**
        *   (existing bullet-points remain unchanged)…

2.  **Implement Consistency-Metric Computation:**
    *   **Files:** `churns/core/metrics.py` (new), `image_assessment` stage update.
    *   **Task:** After `image_generation`, compute:
        *   CLIP similarity between the new output and the original recipe’s reference image.
        *   Δ-histogram distance of colour palettes.
    *   Store results in `ctx.generated_image_results[i]['consistency_metrics']` and surface via `/results`.
    *   Threshold (≥ 0.85 CLIP) used by E2E Test Case 2.

3.  **Create `StyleAdaptation` Stage:**
    *   **File:** `churns/stages/style_adaptation.py`
    *   **Task:** Create this new, specialized LLM stage. It is triggered when a user applies a `STYLE_RECIPE` *and* provides a new text prompt.
    *   **System Prompt:** Use the detailed prompt from Section 4.1, ensuring the **negative constraint** is included: *"You are FORBIDDEN from making small, corrective 'refinement' style edits."*

4.  **Enhance `StyleAdaptation` with Edge-Case Logic:**
    *   **File:** `churns/stages/style_adaptation.py`
    *   **Task:** Before calling the LLM, implement the supplemental logic for series templates from Section 3.5. This "Style Merge" logic is critical for reliability.
        *   Check for subject ratio differences and adjust `composition_and_framing`.
        *   Handle `override_text_visuals` if provided.
        *   Blend color palettes if the new subject's dominant color clashes with the template.
        *   Check for logo occlusion and move it to an alternate position if needed.

5.  **Implement Token Budget Mitigation:**
    *   **File:** Create a new utility, e.g., `churns/core/prompt_utils.py`.
    *   **Task:** Before the `StyleAdaptation` stage, implement the token budget strategy from Section 3.6. Create a utility to estimate the token count of the combined prompt. If it exceeds ~85% of the model's limit, intelligently prune non-essential, verbose fields (like `creative_reasoning`) from the recipe before sending the request.

6.  **Logo File Optimisation Flow:**
    *   **File:** `churns/api/routers.py` (upload path), `churns/core/image_utils.py` (new).
    *   **Task:** When a user uploads a logo asset:
        *   Generate a ≤ 200 KB PNG preview for prompt embedding.
        *   Store original file in S3 / object storage; keep preview path in preset.

---

### Phase 3: Frontend Implementation
**Goal:** Build a clear, intuitive UI for managing and using both "Input Templates" and "Style Recipes", addressing all UX considerations for a professional and interactive experience. We will leverage the existing MUI component library, `react-hook-form`, `framer-motion` for animations, and `react-hot-toast` for user feedback.

**Action Items:**

1.  **Component: The "Load Preset" Dropdown**
    *   **Location:** `front_end/src/components/PipelineForm.tsx`
    *   **Design:** A new `Select` component will be added prominently at the top of the form. It will be sectioned for clarity into **"Templates (New Idea)"** and **"Recipes (Remake This Image)"**. Each `MenuItem` will display the preset `name` and a subtle `Chip` with the `model_id`.
    *   **Workflow:** On mount, fetch presets via `GET /brand-presets`. When a user selects a preset, if it's an `INPUT_TEMPLATE`, populate the form using `react-hook-form`'s `reset()`. If it's a `STYLE_RECIPE`, transition the UI to the "Recipe Active" state.
    *   **Model Version Check:** If the loaded `preset.model_id` does not match the currently selected model, the UI must show a non-blocking warning: *"This style was created with an older model. Results may vary."*

2.  **Component: The "Save Preset" Flow**
    *   **Location:** `front_end/src/components/RunResults.tsx`
    *   **Design:** Add an outlined `<BookmarkAddIcon />` "Save Style" button next to each generated image. Clicking it opens a `SavePresetDialog` modal with a `TextField` for the recipe name.
    *   **Workflow:** User enters a name and clicks "Save Recipe". The app calls `POST /runs/{run_id}/save-as-preset`. On success, show a `toast.success('Recipe saved!')` and invalidate the presets query cache to refetch.

3.  **UI State: "Recipe Active" Mode**
    *   **Location:** `front_end/src/components/PipelineForm.tsx`
    *   **Design & Animation:** When a `STYLE_RECIPE` is selected, the form will fluidly reconfigure using `framer-motion`:
        *   A **persistent banner** appears: `'Recipe "{preset.name}" is active.'` with a "Clear" button.
        *   Most form fields are `disabled` and visually faded.
        *   A **visual preview** of the original recipe's image is shown.
        *   Two clear paths appear: **Path A (ImageUploader)** labeled "Swap the Subject" and **Path B (TextField)** labeled "Create a New Concept with this Style".
    *   **Workflow:** The `onSubmit` logic adapts to send the `preset_id` with either the new `image_file` (Path A) or the new `prompt` (Path B).

4.  **Component: Comprehensive Preset Management UI & Brand Kit**
    *   **Location:** `front_end/src/components/` (new `PresetManagementModal.tsx`)
    *   **Task:** Build the full preset management modal, which includes the Brand Kit UI.
        *   **Logo Uploader:** A clean, single-file upload area with a visual preview. On upload, provide toast feedback for optimization: `“Optimized preview generated (e.g., 178 KB). Original stored separately.”`
        *   **Color Palette Editor:** An interactive component allowing users to add/remove multiple colors via a color picker (e.g., `react-color`).

5.  **Component: Consistency-Score Badge**
    *   **Location:** `front_end/src/components/RunResults.tsx`
    *   **Design:** When viewing results from a `STYLE_RECIPE` run, display a `Chip` component as a badge on each new image.
        *   **Content:** `Consistency: 92%` (from backend metrics).
        *   **Tooltip:** On hover, show a breakdown: `Stylistic Match (CLIP): 95%, Color Palette Match: 89%`.

6.  **Enforce UI Distinction from Refinement:**
    *   **Task:** This is a guiding principle. Ensure the "Style Adaptation" workflow is only accessible via selecting a "Recipe" in the main pipeline form. The existing "Refinement" tools must remain separate UI elements on the image result view to prevent user confusion.

---

### Phase 4: Testing & Validation
**Goal:** Ensure the feature is robust, reliable, and meets all functional and non-functional requirements.

**Action Items:**

1.  **Backend Unit & Integration Tests:**
    *   **Task:** Write comprehensive tests for the API, `StyleAdaptation` stage logic (including precedence rules and edge-case handling), and pipeline stage-skipping.

2.  **Frontend Unit Tests:**
    *   **Task:** Write tests for the preset management components and the dynamic state changes in the `PipelineForm` when a recipe is active.

3.  **End-to-End Test Matrix:**
    *   **Task:** Execute the full E2E test matrix from Section 5.
        *   **Test Case 1 (Template Creation & Use):** Verify full pipeline run with a loaded template.
        *   **Test Case 2 (Recipe Re-run - Subject Swap):** Assert a high CLIP similarity score (≥ 0.85) to the original, validating stylistic consistency.
        *   **Test Case 3 (Recipe with Override - Style Transfer):** Verify `StyleAdaptation` is called and correctly merges concepts.

4.  **Practicality Check:**
    *   **Task:** Investigate if the underlying image generation API supports a deterministic `generation_seed`. If so, store and reuse it for `STYLE_RECIPE` presets to offer maximum reproducibility. If not, omit this to avoid setting false expectations. The primary consistency guarantee remains the reused `visual_concept`.

---

### Phase 5: Optional Enhancements (Post-MVP)
**Goal:** Provide roadmap items that are valuable but not blocking for the first release.

1.  **Batch Generation Mode (CSV):** Back-end async job runner + front-end uploader.
2.  **Low-Resolution Preview Step:** Generate 256-px draft after `StyleAdaptation`, let user approve before full cost run.
3.  **Reset-to-Base Recipe Control:** UI button + executor flag to reload immutable `base_style_recipe` to counter drift.
4.  **Stale-Template Warning Banner:** Add `last_verified_at` to presets, compare against `brand_kit.updated_at`; show warning before run.
5.  **Consistency-Metrics Dashboard:** Surface historical consistency scores to help QA large campaigns.
