# Brand Color Enhancement: Implementation Plan

## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines a detailed plan to implement the enhanced brand color component proposed in `BRAND_COLOR_ENHANCEMENT.md`. The current implementation is basic, allowing users to select a flat list of colors with no semantic meaning or guidance. This leads to suboptimal results from the AI image generation pipeline and a less-than-ideal user experience.

The proposed enhancement will transform the brand color editor into an intelligent "design partner" by introducing a tiered UI with progressive disclosure, semantic color roles, automated suggestions, and validation. This will empower users to create cohesive, brand-aligned color palettes, resulting in higher-quality AI-generated visuals.

This plan covers the required changes across the entire stack: frontend components, backend APIs, and the AI pipeline stages.

## 2. Current State Analysis

-   **Frontend:**
    -   `ColorPaletteEditor.tsx`: A simple component that allows users to add/edit/remove up to 4 hex color codes. It lacks semantic roles, ratio controls, or any form of intelligent guidance.
    -   `PresetManagementModal.tsx`: Uses `ColorPaletteEditor.tsx` to create brand kits.
    -   `PipelineForm.tsx`: Applies brand kit presets, but the underlying color data is just a list of strings.
-   **Backend:**
    -   `churns/models/__init__.py`: The `BrandKitInput` model defines `colors` as an `Optional[List[str]]`, a simple list of hex color strings.
    -   `churns/api/schemas.py`: The API schemas use `BrandKitInput` to transfer brand kit data.
-   **AI Pipeline:**
    -   `churns/stages/style_guide.py`: The `style_guide` stage receives the list of color strings and includes them in the prompt to the LLM with the generic instruction to be "inspired by these colors."
    -   `churns/stages/creative_expert.py`: The `creative_expert` stage also receives the raw list of colors and is instructed to create a color palette that "prominently features or complements" them.

The current implementation lacks the structured, semantic data needed for the AI to make intelligent decisions about color application.

## 3. Proposed Enhancements & Implementation Plan

This implementation will be divided into three phases: Backend & Data Model changes, Frontend Component development, and AI Pipeline integration.

### Phase 1: Backend and Data Model Updates

The foundation of this enhancement is a more descriptive data model for brand colors.

#### 1.1. Update Pydantic Models

We will replace the simple list of strings with a more structured model that includes roles, hex values, and optional user-defined labels.

**File:** `churns/models/__init__.py`

```python
// New Pydantic model for a single color entry
class BrandColor(BaseModel):
    hex: str = Field(..., description="The hex code of the color (e.g., '#4A90E2').")
    role: str = Field(..., description="The semantic role of the color (e.g., 'primary', 'accent', 'neutral_dark', 'neutral_light').")
    label: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="An optional user-defined label for the color (e.g., 'Ocean Blue').")
    ratio: Optional[float] = Field(None, description="Optional user-defined ratio for the color's usage (0.0 to 1.0).")

// Update BrandKitInput model
class BrandKitInput(BaseModel):
    """Brand Kit input structure for unified brand management"""
    colors: Optional[List[BrandColor]] = Field(None, description="A list of brand colors with semantic roles.")
    brand_voice_description: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="Brand voice description")
    logo_file_base64: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="Base64 encoded logo file")
    # ... other fields
```

#### 1.2. Update API Schemas

The API schemas will be updated to use the new `BrandKitInput` model. This change will be transparent to most of the API as it already uses the `BrandKitInput` model. The primary change will be in how the frontend constructs the request.

**File:** `churns/api/schemas.py`

No changes are required in this file, as it already references `BrandKitInput`. The changes in `churns/models/__init__.py` will propagate automatically.

#### 1.3. Database Migration (If Necessary)

We need to analyze if brand presets stored in the database need migration. If presets store the `brand_kit` as a JSON blob, a migration script might be needed to update the structure of the `colors` field from a list of strings to a list of `BrandColor` objects.

**Action Item:** Write a migration script in `migrate_sqlite.py` to handle this transformation. The script should be idempotent and handle cases where the old or new format is present.

### Phase 2: Frontend Component Development

This phase focuses on building the new, interactive color palette editor.

#### 2.1. Enhance `ColorPaletteEditor.tsx`

The existing `ColorPaletteEditor.tsx` component will be completely overhauled to implement the tiered design described in the enhancement document.

**File:** `front_end/src/components/ColorPaletteEditor.tsx` (To be modified)

**Tier 1: Default View**

-   **Semantic Roles:** Implement sections for "Primary," "Accent," and "Neutrals."
-   **Color Pickers:** Use a component like `react-colorful` for an intuitive color selection experience. Each color should have an input for a hex code and an optional label.
-   **Automated Neutrals:** Automatically suggest a dark and light neutral (e.g., `#1A1A1A` and `#F9F9F9`). These should be displayed but editable.
-   **Live Preview:** A simple component that displays the selected colors together.
-   **Advanced Settings Toggle:** A button to reveal Tier 2.

**Tier 2: Advanced View**

-   **Expanded Roles:** Allow users to add more colors under "Primary" (up to 2), "Secondary" (up to 3), and "Accent" (up to 2) categories, with a total cap of 7 colors.
-   **Ratio Sliders (Optional):** Under a sub-toggle, reveal sliders for power users to fine-tune color ratios. The UI should ensure the ratios sum to 100%.
-   **Drag-and-Drop Reordering:** Allow users to reorder colors within a role to signify priority. Libraries like `react-beautiful-dnd` can be used.

**Tier 3: Intelligent Helpers**

-   **Extract from Logo:**
    -   Leverage the existing `LogoUploader` component. Add an "Extract Colors" button that becomes enabled after a logo has been uploaded.
    -   On the backend, create a new API endpoint (e.g., `/api/v1/brand-kit/extract-colors-from-image`) that uses a library like `color-thief` to extract a color palette from the uploaded image.
    -   The frontend will call this endpoint and populate the color roles with the extracted colors.
-   **Color Harmony Suggestions:**
    -   After a primary color is selected, a "Suggestions" button will appear.
    -   On click, call a new backend endpoint (e.g., `/api/v1/brand-kit/color-harmonies`) that takes a color and returns complementary, analogous, and triadic color suggestions.
-   **Accessibility Checker:**
    -   Implement a real-time WCAG contrast checker. Use a library like `tinycolor2` to calculate contrast ratios between colors (e.g., primary vs. neutral for text).
    -   Display a warning icon if the contrast is insufficient.

#### 2.2. Update Component Integration

Since we are modifying the existing `ColorPaletteEditor.tsx`, no component replacement is needed. The primary task is to ensure that components like `PresetManagementModal.tsx` correctly pass and receive the new `BrandColor[]` data structure.

**File:** `front_end/src/components/PresetManagementModal.tsx`

```typescript
// ... imports
import ColorPaletteEditor from './ColorPaletteEditor'; // Import remains the same

// ... inside the component
<ColorPaletteEditor
  colors={brandKitData.colors} // This prop will now expect an array of BrandColor objects
  onChange={(colors) => setBrandKitData(prev => ({ ...prev, colors }))}
/>
```

### Phase 3: AI Pipeline Integration

With the enhanced data structure, we can now provide much better context to the AI pipeline.

#### 3.1. Update `style_guide.py`

The `_get_style_guider_user_prompt` function will be updated to format the new color data into a human-readable and machine-understandable prompt.

**File:** `churns/stages/style_guide.py`

```python
# ... in _get_style_guider_user_prompt function

if brand_kit and brand_kit.get('colors'):
    prompt_parts.append("\n**Brand Color Palette:**")
    prompt_parts.append("Your style suggestions MUST be compatible with this color palette. Use the roles and ratios to guide your color choices.")
    for color in brand_kit['colors']:
        role = color.get('role', 'N/A').replace('_', ' ').title()
        label = f" ({color.get('label')})" if color.get('label') else ""
        ratio = f" (Usage Ratio: {int(color.get('ratio', 0) * 100)}%)" if color.get('ratio') else ""
        prompt_parts.append(f"- **{role} Color{label}:** `{color.get('hex')}`{ratio}")

```

#### 3.2. Update `creative_expert.py`

Similarly, the `_get_creative_expert_user_prompt` will be updated to leverage the new color structure.

**File:** `churns/stages/creative_expert.py`

```python
# ... in _get_creative_expert_user_prompt function

if apply_branding_flag and brand_kit and brand_kit.get('colors'):
    prompt_parts.append("\n**Brand Kit Integration (CRITICAL):**")
    # ... other brand kit elements

    prompt_parts.append("- **Brand Colors:**")
    for color in brand_kit['colors']:
        role = color.get('role', 'N/A').replace('_', ' ').title()
        label = f" ({color.get('label')})" if color.get('label') else ""
        ratio = f" (Inferred Usage: {int(color.get('ratio', 0) * 100)}%)" if color.get('ratio') else ""
        prompt_parts.append(f"  - {role}: `{color.get('hex')}`{label}{ratio}")
    
    prompt_parts.append(f"- In the `color_palette` field of your response, you MUST define a specific color scheme that prominently features or complements this full set of brand colors, respecting their semantic roles and ratios.")
```
