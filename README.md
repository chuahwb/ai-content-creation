## üîÑ **Development Workflow**

### **Code Modification Commands**

#### **Backend Changes Only** (Auto-Reload ‚úÖ)
```bash
docker-compose up
# Python files in churns/ reload automatically
```

#### **Frontend Changes** (Rebuild Required üîÑ)
```bash
docker-compose up --build
# Rebuilds frontend container (~30-60 seconds)
```

#### **Full Development Mode** (Both Auto-Reload ‚úÖ)
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
# Both backend and frontend hot-reload instantly
```

### **Git Best Practices**
- **Commit Frequently**: Make small, atomic commits for each logical change.
- **Write Clear Messages**: Explain the "what" and "why" of your changes.
- **Use Branches**: Create separate branches for new features or bug fixes to keep `main` stable.

### **Quick Reference**
- **Production Testing**: Use `docker-compose.yml` (current default)
- **Active Development**: Use `docker-compose.dev.yml` (faster iteration)
- **First Time Setup**: Always use `--build` to ensure fresh builds
- **Port Access**: Frontend `http://localhost:3000`, API `http://localhost:8000`
